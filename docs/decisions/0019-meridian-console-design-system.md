# ADR 0019: Meridian — the console design system

Names and fixes the console's design language: **Meridian** — deep blue-black
wells, one teal accent, violet attention, humanist type with mono reserved for
identifiers, dark-first with a fully specified light mode. It replaces the
first-generation "instrument panel" styling, which grew surface by surface
without a recorded system, leaving each new surface to re-derive (or drift
from) the same choices.

This record carries the **rules** — the hard-to-reverse semantic commitments
every surface must obey. The full high-fidelity specification (exact token
values, type scale, per-surface mocks and behavior) is frozen as artifact
`MMR-a42` on the implementation initiative `MMR-215`; pixels may be tuned
there without touching this record. This ADR also extracts the
Overview/attention model into a decision of its own (§9) — ADR 0013 had been
absorbing it as an ever-growing list of refinements.

## The decision

1. **Every hue owns exactly one job.** Four color roles, and roles never
   borrow each other's hues:
   - **Accent (teal)** — selection, active controls, links, focus. Rendered as
     _washes_ (low-alpha fill + hairline inset ring), never solid fills. Never
     marks state.
   - **Action** — the one solid button per surface. Teal-filled in dark;
     slate-filled in light (teal fills read wrong on white).
   - **Attention (violet)** — the "needs you" set only: the top-bar badge,
     verdict blocks, under-review emphasis.
   - **Status (×9)** — dots, 2px card left-borders, bar segments, tinted
     chips. Status hues never fill buttons; control hues never mark state.

2. **Attention is violet, deliberately not red.** The attention set leads with
   `under_review` — work asking for a verdict, not work that is broken. Review
   is opportunity, not error; red stays reserved for the `blocked` status hue.
   This closes the long-open badge-color question (`MMR-103`, which shipped
   red as a conventional notification affordance and was twice deferred).

3. **The status vocabulary is closed at nine and consumed identically
   everywhere** — one mapping for dots, borders, bars, chips, and the mobile
   status sheet (the ADR 0008 vocabulary, projected visually). _Going cold_ is
   a temperature **modifier** (glyph + demoted ink riding whatever status or
   lane a node holds), never a tenth status and never a fifth lane.

4. **Review is verdict-first.** Approving or returning submitted work is the
   highest-leverage operator action in the system, so an `under_review` node
   leads with its verdict block — submitted summary, external ref, inline
   Approve / Return — on every surface that shows it (board card, detail
   views, tree row), not behind a generic menu.

5. **Verbs are labeled chips; the kebab is retired.** Status moves only
   through verbs (ADR 0001), and the affordance now says so: a visible,
   labeled chip row scoped to the legal transitions, everywhere a node can be
   acted on.

6. **Two type voices with a hard boundary.** A humanist sans (Instrument Sans)
   for all prose and UI text; a monospace (JetBrains Mono) strictly for
   machine vocabulary — ids, keys, tags, timestamps-as-data. The uppercase
   microlabel is the single all-caps idiom (column/lane/section captions).
   Fonts are self-hosted (the console is a PWA; no runtime font CDN).

7. **Light mode is a translation, not a recolor.** Six conversion rules cover
   every surface; anything unlisted converts by token table alone: washes gain
   an inset ring; glow becomes a real shadow ramp (shadow from ink, not
   black); demotion drops an ink tier instead of opacity (opacity is reserved
   for the offline full-page demotion); machine ground stays dark (source/code
   readouts keep the dark well inside light surfaces — the inversion marks the
   boundary between UI and record); amber text on white uses the darkened
   family, the bright variant is decoration-only; unvalidated token values are
   validated on a rendered composite before implementation locks them.

8. **The motion budget is exhaustive.** Three movers: the in-progress pulse
   dot, the detail panel/sheet slide, and note expand/collapse. Nothing else
   moves — no hover lifts, no springs. Adding a fourth mover is a revisit of
   this ADR, not a styling choice.

9. **The Overview/attention model, extracted.** Decided across
   `MMR-100`–`MMR-111` and previously recorded only as ADR 0013 refinements;
   this section is now the decision of record:
   - **Attention** names the top-bar alert only: the cross-project set that
     needs the operator — `under_review` → `blocked` → _going cold_ — ordered
     by how much the operator's action moves it. Healthy `in_progress`/`ready`
     work is never "attention"; a stale item surfaces as _going cold_, not its
     healthy status word.
   - **Lane** names the Overview's per-project standing: four values in
     action-impact order, highest-wins over a project's leaf tasks
     (`awaiting_you` → `live` → `needs_unsticking` → `at_rest`),
     recency-ordered within a lane, `at_rest` folded away. The Lane vocabulary
     is deliberately four values, not the status set — it is the
     operator-facing sibling of the container rollup word.
   - The two are distinct concepts with distinct names; reusing "attention"
     for both was the naming bug the `MMR-111` rename fixed.

## Why

- **A recorded system is what keeps N surfaces one product.** The console now
  spans board, tree, detail, browsers, authoring, and the roadmap surfaces
  (seeds, record health, archive). Without fixed roles, each surface
  re-answers "what does teal mean here" — the drift the one-hue-one-job rule
  exists to prevent, and the reason the light board clashed before the role
  split.
- **The semantic commitments are the expensive part.** Hexes and paddings are
  cheap to tune; what a hue _means_, whether review reads as error, and
  whether motion is scarce are commitments every future surface builds on —
  exactly the "expensive to reverse" bar for an ADR.
- **Verdict-first follows from the model.** `under_review` ranks just under
  `in_progress` in the interpret cascade (ADR 0008) and leads the attention
  set; a design system that buries the approve/return affordance in a generic
  menu contradicts the model's own priority.
- **The attention model deserved its own record.** Three refinement sections
  on ADR 0013 (and counting) is how a decision hides; extraction gives the
  Lane/Attention split one citable home while 0013 keeps the SPA-shape
  decision it actually made.

## Considered and rejected

- **Red attention badge** — conventional for notification counts, wrong for a
  set led by the non-error `under_review`; it taxes the operator with false
  alarm. (Shipped in v0.12, now reversed.)
- **Status hues on controls** (status-colored buttons/fills) — collapses the
  state/control distinction the role system draws; a colored button reads as
  both an action and a state and is ambiguous as either.
- **A `cold` status or a fifth `going_cold` lane** — staleness is orthogonal
  to both axes; modeling it as a value would fork the closed vocabularies
  (ADR 0008's cascade and the four-lane order) for a decoration.
- **Light mode as an independent theme** — a second design to maintain and
  drift; the translation rules keep light derivable from dark plus six
  exceptions.
- **Keeping the kebab for verbs** — hides the system's most important
  affordances behind an unlabeled control; fine for a read-only console,
  wrong once intervention is the job.
- **A per-surface motion vocabulary** — motion that varies by surface reads
  as inconsistency, not richness, at this density; the scarce budget is what
  makes the pulse dot legible as "live."

## Consequences

- Implementation is initiative `MMR-215` (foundation re-skin, then surface
  recreations), deliberately sequenced after the storage cutover
  (`MMR-131`); design artifact `MMR-a42` is the normative spec. This ADR
  governs any conflict between an implementation shortcut and the rules
  above.
- Tokens land in the existing `@theme` vocabulary (`well-*`, `ink-*`, `line`,
  `accent`, `status-*`) plus new `--action` and `--attention` roles. Status
  classes stay literal for Tailwind static extraction, or gain a
  token-indirection layer — decided at the foundation task, not per surface.
- ADR 0013 remains the decision of record for the SPA shape, navigation
  grammar, board-as-primary-lens, and offline posture; its attention-model
  refinements (v0.12/v0.13) are historical narrative superseded by §9. A
  dated pointer is appended there.
- The `MMR-103` badge-color open question is closed by §2.
- New surfaces (seeds, record health, archive) inherit the role system as a
  constraint: e.g. record-damage surfacing is amber ("the system is
  behaving"), never red, and never joins the violet needs-you set's hue.
